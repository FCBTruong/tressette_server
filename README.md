Hi Recruiter,

This is one of my key projects â€” a real-time online multiplayer game I built to showcase my backend development skills.

The backend is written in **Python** using **FastAPI**, and communicates via **WebSocket** using **Protobuf** for efficient data transfer.  
It includes login via Firebase, full multiplayer logic, and supports integrated payments (Apple, Google, PayPal).  
The system runs on **AWS ECS**, uses **PostgreSQL** for storage, **Redis** for caching, and **Amazon S3** for hosting static assets and CDN.

Iâ€™ve also implemented async architecture using Pythonâ€™s `async/await` to handle concurrent connections smoothly.


You can play the game at: [https://tressette.clareentertainment.com/](https://tressette.clareentertainment.com/)
or download it from Google Play and the App Store (search **Tressette Royal Online**).

Here are some screenshots:
